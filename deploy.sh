# Sync plugin from dev folder to Moodle installation and rebuild AMD.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy.sh                 Deploy to every install in MOODLE_DIRS.
#   ./deploy.sh --zip           Deploy, then build a release zip.
#   ./deploy.sh --zip-only      Build the release zip; deploy nothing.
#   ./deploy.sh --zip --force   Build even with uncommitted changes.
#   ./deploy.sh --zip --suffix=212
#                               Override the version suffix in the zip's
#                               filename (default: the release with its dots
#                               removed, so 2.12.0 becomes 2120).
#
# Zipping is opt-in because a deploy happens on every test run and a release
# does not.

# Build an installable release zip from the committed tree.
#
# git archive rather than a copy-and-delete: it takes only tracked files, so
# vendor/ and .git/ cannot leak in, and the rest of the exclusions live in
# .gitattributes as export-ignore instead of in someone's memory. The flip side
# is that it archives HEAD, so uncommitted work is not in the zip - deliberate
# for a release, but worth saying out loud.
#
# The directory inside the zip MUST be "unifiedgrader". Moodle's installer
# compares it against the component declared in version.php:
#
#     if ($reqname !== $this->rootdir) { ... 'componentmismatchname' ... }
#
# so a root named local_unifiedgrader, or one carrying a version suffix, is
# rejected. The suffix belongs in the filename only. A zip built by Finder's
# "Compress" also fails, because the __MACOSX folder it adds is a second root
